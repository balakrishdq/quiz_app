# quiz_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

As the following instructions the quiz app is developed. 

When the user is enter into the app there is a home page with one title and an logo image, below that there is a start button for guest users, That performs the quiz test without login. 

In this app there are some packages are used such as,
  ## 1.Firebase Core
  ## 2.Firebase Auth
  ## 3.Firebase Cloud Firestore
  ## 4.Google Sign In
  ## 5.Provider 
  ## 6.Google Fonts
  ## 7.Gap
  
***From the above packages the quiz app is created and also a timer is attached inside the app. Timer is not for seperate questions that will fix the time, before that the user should have to finish the quiz***

The questions for the quiz are showing sequentially, at the end the result will show to the user. At the bottom there is an leaderboard button by clicking that user will see the leaderboard. 

***At first the user can attend the test and the score will be updated, After attending the test second time the highest score is updated in the list***

Firebase is binded for authentication and backend data storage. 

The firebase project is created for android, Ios and Web. For authentication **GOOGLE AUTH** is used and for backend storage purpose the cloud firestore is installed.

App is configured with web also and its also hosted by firebase hosting.
